# 🔒 Security Guidelines for Unity Input System

This document outlines security practices and recommendations for using and developing with the Unity Input System package. Following these guidelines ensures your project remains secure and resilient against potential threats.

---

## 🛡️ General Security Practices

- **Update Regularly**: Always use the latest stable version of the Unity Input System to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
- **Validate Inputs**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive configuration files and ensure only authorized personnel can modify them.

---

## 🔐 Security in Development

- **Secure Test Environment**:
  - Use isolated environments when testing new features or unstable versions of the Input System.
  - Avoid using production credentials in test environments.

- **Code Reviews**:
  - Regularly review your code for security vulnerabilities, especially when implementing custom devices or composites.
  - Follow Unity’s [Secure Coding Guidelines](https://unity.com/security) for best practices.

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Verify the integrity of third-party dependencies before including them in your project.
  - Monitor third-party libraries for security advisories.

---

## 🔄 Runtime Security

- **User Permissions**:
  - Request only necessary permissions for input devices.
  - Clearly communicate to users why permissions are needed and how their data will be used.

- **Input Monitoring**:
  - Regularly monitor input device data to detect abnormal behaviors, which could indicate tampering or attacks.
  - Use logging and analytics tools to audit input activity.

## 🔗 Secure Network Usage

If your project involves networked multiplayer or online interactions:

- **Encrypt Data**: Always encrypt input-related data during transmission to prevent interception or tampering.
- **Authentication**: Use robust authentication mechanisms for all connected clients.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of input systems in networked environments.

---

## 🔧 Secure Custom Implementations

When implementing custom features, such as devices or composites:

- **Input Binding Restrictions**:
  - Limit input bindings to expected ranges or values.
  - Validate bindings to ensure they do not conflict with critical system functions.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensure all exceptions are handled gracefully to avoid revealing sensitive details.

## 📢 Reporting Vulnerabilities

Unity Technologies encourages the community to report security vulnerabilities to maintain a safe and secure ecosystem. If you discover a security issue:

1. Contact Unity’s security team via [security@unity3d.com](mailto:security@unity3d.com).
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
3. Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until Unity has released a fix.
